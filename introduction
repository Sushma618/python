Python Introduction & PVM

1. Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language**.
2. It is easy to learn and uses **simple, readable syntax**.
3. Python is used in **automation, web development, cloud, data science, and AI**.
4. Python programs are written in **`.py` files**.
5. Python does **not execute source code directly**.
6. Source code is first converted into **bytecode**.
7. Bytecode is a **platform-independent intermediate code**.
8. Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode.
9. PVM runs the program **line by line and produces output**.
10. PVM makes Python **platform-independent** (runs on Windows, Linux, macOS).
